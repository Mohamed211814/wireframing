📐 Introduction to Wireframing
What is Wireframing?
Wireframing is the process of creating a simplified, visual representation of a webpage or application interface. Think of it as a blueprint—it outlines the structure and layout of content, features, and navigation without focusing on design details like colors, fonts, or images.

Wireframes can be low-fidelity (basic sketches) or high-fidelity (detailed, digital mockups), depending on the project's stage and goals.

Why is Wireframing Important?
Wireframing plays a crucial role in the design process for several reasons:

🎯 Clarifies Ideas: Translates abstract concepts into visual forms that teams can discuss and iterate on.

👥 Improves Communication: Acts as a common reference for designers, developers, and stakeholders.

🧠 Identifies Usability Issues Early: Helps catch layout or navigation problems before investing in full design or development.

🔄 Saves Time and Resources: It’s easier and cheaper to revise a wireframe than to change a finished product.
