🧩 Key Elements of a Wireframe
Understanding the core components of a wireframe helps ensure a well-organized and user-friendly design. Below are the most important elements:

1. Layout Structure
Defines the overall arrangement of elements on the page.

📌 Example: A homepage wireframe may show a header at the top, a three-column section in the middle, and a footer at the bottom.
✅ Contribution: Helps visualize content flow and spatial hierarchy.

2. Navigation
Shows how users will move between different parts of the product.

📌 Example: A top nav bar with links to “Home,” “About,” “Services,” and “Contact.”
✅ Contribution: Ensures users can easily find and access key sections of the site or app.

3. Content Placement
Marks where text, images, videos, or calls-to-action will appear.

📌 Example: A wireframe may include placeholders for a hero image, an introductory paragraph, and a newsletter sign-up box.
✅ Contribution: Organizes content for clarity and effective communication.

4. Functionality
Indicates interactive components or behaviors.

📌 Example: Buttons, dropdown menus, search bars, or login fields shown in the layout.
✅ Contribution: Helps developers and designers understand what features the user will interact with and how.
